## About development

# About this repo

I just want to share my power automate files but I couldn't get any fast way to do it.

Then I realised this way of sharing the power automate as text

So, I made this repo to share these files and make everyone's life a bit better

Please, share any issues with the flows

Contact me for any improvements.
